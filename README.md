## Setup react-project 
Download vs-code & Install Nodejs.

Create folder in vs-code and within this folder run:
```npx create-react-app [NAME_OF_APP]```

Now we have a react-project structure created. To run the project and get it running locally we go into the react app folder and type into the terminal: ```npm run start```

## Libraries used:
* Styled-components
* Material-UI

## Change _base-information_ about user:
One can do this within the projects manifest file. This file contain a json-object called profile which can be populated with infromation connected to the user. This _base-information_ will automaticly end up everywhere this _base-information_ is used.
